# Machine Learning Concepts

Throughout the course of the 6 month bootcamp, we learned different AI Concepts,
including the below mentioned types of Machine Learning.

## Supervised Learning

When we are working with a labeled dataset, it gives us the ability to use that
to predict values/behaviors based on "studying" the dataset. It can be used in
classification or regression problems, where the model is trained on that labeled
dataset and predicts target values.

An example of such would be

## Unsupervised Learning

Clustering KMeans

## Reinforced Learning

A staged type of learning where every time the model is run, adjustments and 
improvements are made to improve the next stage.
