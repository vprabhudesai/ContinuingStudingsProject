# Machine Learning Concepts

Throughout the course of the 6 month bootcamp, we learned different AI Concepts,
including the below mentioned types of Machine Learning.

## Supervised Learning

When we are working with a labeled dataset, it gives us the ability to use that
to predict values/behaviors based on "studying" the dataset. It can be used in
classification or regression problems, where the model is trained on that labeled
dataset and predicts target values.

Example: Using a the historical data for the past 10 years of heart disease, which
includes patient data, symptoms, and whether or not they suffer from the condition,
we can used RandomForestClassifier to determine which symptoms are the most relevant.

## Unsupervised Learning

With unlabeled data, we can still draw information from the set. A common method
in unsupervised learning is clustering. We can group the data set into different
"clusters" based on similarities.

Example: For consumer spending in a shopping center, with data that shows only 
transaction data, we can determine groups based on the amount spent and frequency.

## Reinforced Learning

A staged type of learning where every time the model is run, adjustments and 
improvements are made to improve the next stage.

Examples that I've seen in practice is with games like chess engines. As the game
develops, different movesets/patterns are created.
